=== Why I Wrote This Book

An educator friend once told me that STEMCstudio seems complex, but it isn't. At the time I was taking him on a personal tour through STEMCstudio. Of course, I can't do that with every potential STEMCstudio user. I have produced a number of YouTube videos about STEMCstudio and Geometric Algebra but these are sequential access and don't capture recent developments. 

To be used effectively, every software system deserves an up-to-date system manual.

I was originally motivated to write STEMCstudio as a means to explore Physics and Mathematics concepts through Computational Modeling. Bringing the value of experiencing what are normally abstract concepts to students was sufficient motivation for me to scratch together a Wiki describing STEMCstudio.

When educators got interested in STEMCstudio for dynamic content authoring, and the when the transformational potential of Learning Tools Interoperability was understood, I felt it was time to produce a book. A book can be published in multiple formats that reduce the cognitive load in making use of the book content. Given the ease and quality of technical publishing based on modern technologies, there was no excuse!

=== Rendering Mathematics with MathJax

https://www.mathjax.org

Rendering mathematical notation in your application can be done by using _MathJax_. There are two use cases to consider: `auto rendering` and `manual rendering`.

==== MathJax auto rendering

Auto rendering means that you will define static TeX expressions in your `index.html` file that will be asynchronously processed by MathJax into MathML.

Implementing auto rendering in STEMCstudio is achieved by following the MathJax documentation. This essentially involves including a `script` tag in your `index.html` file to load MathJax

NOTE: For MathJax auto rendering it is permissable to load the MathJax script asynchronously using the `async` attribute.

This example was taken from the following project:

==== MathJax manual rendering

Manual rendering means that you will define dynamic TeX expressions in your `*.ts` files that will be processed by MathJax into MathML.

Implementing MathJax manual rendering in STEMCstudio requires that you trigger MathJax to render expressions on the page using the `typeset` function on the global `MathJax` object.

In the example above the MathJax global variable is accessed through the global `window` object. This prevents type errors being reported by short-circuiting the type checking.

In this example the loading of the MathJax script must be performed _synchronously_ so that the `MathJax` global variable is available when the `typeset` function is called.

NOTE: The `async` attribute is removed from the `script` tag so that the `MathJax` script is loaded synchronously.

=== Dynamic Registration

Dynamic Registration is an automated process for establishing secure communication parameters for the tool (STEMCstudio in this case) and the platform (e.g. Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, Sakai). Once registration is complete, the tool can be launched securely using the identity of the user logged into the LMS.

The URL to use for dynamically registering STEMCstudio is `https://stemcstudio.com/tool`.

=== Data Visualization with Plotly

==== Plotly

Plotly is a JavaScript Open Source Graphing Library.

A useful starting point for examples provides by the _plotly_ folks is https://plotly.com/javascript/. It is usually fairly straightforward to adapt these to TypeScript and use them in STEMCstudio.

You can try the application at the following URL:

The code for this example can be found at the following URL:

The official _npm_ page is https://www.npmjs.com/package/plotly.js. This page informs you of the versions and locations on the CDN. However, you should load _plotly.js_ in STEMCstudio using the _system.config.json_ file:

[source,json,linenos]
._system.config.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/8191c1070bc5d68cd223a33f01ce4d53/raw/system.config.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

Unfortunately, the developers behind _plotly_ don't provide the TypeScript type definitions. However, a number of versions are hosted on the STEMCstudio server. 

[source,json,linenos]
._types.config.json_

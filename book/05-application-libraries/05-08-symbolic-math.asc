=== Symbolic Mathematics

Using Symbolic Mathematics in an educational activity provides the opportunity to create more interesting problems. 

Up till now this has been achieved by using specialized LMS plugins that invoke remote servers to transform expressions e.g. STACK. In STEMCstudio, the approach taken is to use a library that runs in the web browser. The ideas behind this new approach are to provide greater flexibility, to avoid the scaling issues caused by multiple users, and avoid the installation and versioning issues with a server-side implementation.  

The definition of *Symbolic Mathematics* is rather broad. In the context of authoring STEMC educational activities, we may be interested in being able to verify that the input from a student matches some expression without regard to ambiguities in the ordering of terms and factors. One way to do this is to take advantage of the fact that symbolic mathematics processors typically normalize expressions and convert them to a canonical representation. This will be the focus of this example.

There are several JavaScript libraries available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this example we will look at a library that is still under development that aims to fulfill this niche.

Our demonstration example allows the user to enter a mathematical expression. The parsed and normalized expression tree is then rendered in multiple formats:

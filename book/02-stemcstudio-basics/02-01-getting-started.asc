=== Your First Project

In this section we'll create a simple application in order to explore the essential aspects of the user interface. Our main concern will be to launch the application, save it to GitHub, and reload it in various ways.

==== Creating a New Project

Navigate to the STEMCstudio Home Page at _https://stemcstudio.com_

[#stemcstudio-home-page]
.STEMCstudio Home Page
image::book/02-stemcstudio-basics/images/stemcstudio-home-page.png[]

Press the `Code Now!` button to Create a New Project.

[#stemcstudio-new-project-dialog]
.STEMCstudio New Project Dialog
image::book/02-stemcstudio-basics/images/stemcstudio-new-project-dialog.png[]

Enter a description for your project, e.g. `My First Project`. At this point you could choose a _template_ for your application, that is to say, a working project that will be cloned to make your new project. Let's just take the default and press `OK`.

You will land on the STEMCstudio Workspace page with your new project in the Explorer.

[#stemcstudio-workspace]
.STEMCstudio Workspace

Click on a file in the Explorer View to open the corresponding editor.

[#stemcstudio-editor]
.STEMCstudio Editor

Feel free to explore the workspace, the buttons, and menus. I won't cover every option here, most of them will be familiar if you have used a modern IDE.

==== Launching the Project

Execute the program by pressing the `Launch Program` button, image:images/icons/icon-launch-program.png[], on the main toolbar.

The program web page will run side-by-side with the code.

[#stemcstudio-livecode]
.STEMCstudio Live Coding

Change the greeting name parameter to "Your Name". Notice that any changes you make to the editor code are reflected almost immediately in the Live Code View.

End the program by pressing the `Stop Program` button, image:images/icons/icon-stop-program.png[].

Now return to the Home Page by clicking STEMCstudio brand icon, image:images/icons/icon-stemcstudio-brand.png[].

==== Loading the Project from Local Storage

If you have been following along, you will now be on the STEMCstudio Home Page with your project details displayed under `Local Storage`.

[#stemcstudio-local-storage]
.STEMCstudio Project in Local Storage

Your project is now stored in your current browser on your current machine and nowhere else. That's fine for making changes locally, but you will want to save your work permanently. STEMCstudio allows you to save your work to a GitHub Gist in your GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account, now is a good time to sign up at _https://github.com_.

==== Saving the Project as a GitHub Gist

Click the description of your project in Local Storage to re-open your project in the workspace. Notice that the location URL in your browser is simply `stemcstudio/workspace`. Press the `Sign in to GitHub` button, image:images/icons/icon-stemcstudio-sign-in-to-github.png[].

You will be presented with a popup page from GitHub that allows you to sign in.

[#stemcstudio-github-sign-in-page]
.STEMCstudio GitHub Sign In Page
image::book/02-stemcstudio-basics/images/stemcstudio-github-sign-in-page.png[]
 
Enter your GitHub Username and Password and press the `Sign in` button.

You will be redirected back to STEMCstudio. To save your project as a Gist, click the `Upload Project to GitHub` menu item under the cloud menu, image:images/icons/icon-cloud-menu-enabled.png[]. Your project will be saved, a new Gist identifier will be assigned, and STEMCstudio will reload the project. Notice that the browser URl is now _stemcstudio.com/gists/your-gist-identifier_ 

Anytime that you wish to save your project to GitHub after making changes, simply ensure that you are signed in and upload it.

==== Loading the Project from GitHub

Return from the workspace back to the STEMCstudio Home Page. Your project is in Local Storage but it is also saved in GitHub.

WARNING: Whenever your project is in Local Storage, STEMCstudio will load it from there and not from GitHub. In other words, the copy in Local Storage is your working copy. Be careful not to lose your changes if you are working on more than one computer.

Delete the copy in Local Storage by clicking the tiny `x` symbol next to the project description.

To retrieve your project from GitHub, click the `Download` button on the Home Page.

NOTE: The `Download` button on the Home Page will only be be visible if you are signed in to GitHub.

Click on the description of the project that you wish to download. You will be returned to the workspace with your 

==== Publishing and Finding the Project using the STEMCarXiv

STEMCstudio allows you to index your project for searching in a public archive. The archive name is STEMCarXiv. Adding your project to the STEMCarXiv index is easy. Open your project in the workspace. Ensure that you are signed in to GitHub to enable the cloud menu. Select the `Publish Project to STEMCarXiv` option under the cloud menu. Your project will be indexed based upon meta data such as its description and keywords.

To search for your program in the STEMCarXiv, use the search box on the Home Page.

==== Embedding the Project in a Web Page

Your project may be embedded in a web page. Use the `Embedding Builder` menu item under the `Share Menu` in the workspace view to build the HTML Embed String.

==== Running the Project in STEMCviewer

STEMCstudio has an execute-only companion application called STEMCviewer. This can run your application without loading the design-time parts of STEMCstudio. Simply change the URL in your browser to _stemcviewer.com/gists/your-gist-identifier_.

NOTE: For this to work you must have executed your program and uploaded it to GitHub. The explaination can be found in the _How it Works_ section of this book.

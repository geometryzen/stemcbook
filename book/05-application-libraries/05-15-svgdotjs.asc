=== Manipulating Scalable Vector Graphics with SVG.js

==== Introduction

According to the home page, SVG.js is a lightweight library for manipulating and animating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG.js would be a good choice for 2D rendering in many situations.

The home page is at https://svgjs.dev.

You can try the application at the following URL:

The code for this example can be found at the following URL:

https://www.stemcstudio.com/gists/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb

The official _npm_ page is https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgdotjs/svg.js. This page informs you of the runtime versions and locations on the CDN.

==== Configuration

Configuring your STEMCstudio project to use SVG.js involves creating a dependency on '@svgdotjs/svg.js' in your `package.json` file and having an override in `studio.config.json`.

[source,json,linenos]
._package.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/package.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

An override in `studio.config.json` is necessary in order to find the correct run-time implementation. It is not necessary to specify the location of the TypeScript type definition file because it can be inferred from the SVG.js _package.json_ file.

[source,json,linenos]
._studio.config.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/studio.config.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

As a result of this configuration, the generated _system.config.json_ and _types.config.json_ files will look like:

[source,json,linenos]
._system.config.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/system.config.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The TypeScript type definitions are found from the SVG.js _package.json_ file:

[source,json,linenos]
._types.config.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/types.config.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

==== Usage

In this example, the _index.html_ file provides a container for an `svg` element by using a `div` element with an identifier so that it may be found from JavaScript code.

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/index.html?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The _index.ts_ file constructs the svg element that holds the drawing and adds elements to be rendered.

[source,ts,linenos]
._index.ts_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/4b5eb0effc7500cced291c0eb44251cb/raw/index.ts?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

Consult the official documentation for further details on how to use SVG.js.

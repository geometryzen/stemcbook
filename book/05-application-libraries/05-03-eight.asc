=== 3D Graphics

When we think of 3D Graphics, we are normally referring to a high performance processing pipeline that takes advantage of the parallel processing of the Graphics Processor Unit (GPU). An example of this is _WebGL_. The _WebGL_ API is very low level and not very practical for most STEM education needs where the desire is to use common geometric objects to render scenes. Higher level APIs are available in JavaScript libraries that hide the implementation details of WebGL and provide suitable abstractions for building 3D scenes.

While the _three_ package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) is well known and provides more than adequate functionality for rendering 3D graphics, an alternative is available that is designed to be more suitable for educational purposes. This package is called _davinci_eight_. The core ideas behind this package are:

* Uniform representation of position and attitude using Geometric Algebra. We wanted to avoid the ad-hoc approaches to rotations based on Euler angles and quaternions.
* Written in TypeScript with generated type definitions. We wanted the type definitions to be accurate and the library code to be easier to maintain.
* Designed for extension at all levels in the architecture. We wanted to allow the user to create more sophisticated graphics and new objects by clearly defining the extension points.

While the _davinci_eight_ package has different design objectives, the programming metaphor is very similar to _three_.

Here is an example of some of the out-of-the-box components available.

The _index.html_ file is quite simple. We essentialy need an HTML _canvas_ element on which to construct a WebGL _Rendering Context_.

The _index.ts_ file looks a bit daunting. Let's break it down. The _Engine_ is constructed on the HTML _canvas_ element. This essentially says that we are going to use the _canvas_ element for _WebGL_ purposes. We then create a _PerspectiveCamera_ and a _DirectionalLight_. These are not part of the scene but they do modify the appearance of the scene. Each of these objects implements a _Facet_ interface that provides information when the scene is rendered. The various facets are collected in an _ambients_ array for use during rendering. The _TrackballControls_ instance is an adapter that takes events from your pointer device and modifies the state of the camera. The remaining objects are part of the scene and are collected in the _Scene_ instance. Rendering is performed by the _animate_ function.

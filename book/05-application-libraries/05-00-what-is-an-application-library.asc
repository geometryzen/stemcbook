=== What is an Application Library?

An application library is JavaScript code that performs a specialized function. An application library can improve productivity and consistency through code sharing and reuse. An application library may provide features to render the user interface of your application or it may work behind the scenes to manipulate data. Application libraries may be written by external organization or you may write your own for your specific needs.

NOTE: Chapter 7 provides information on authoring JavaScript libraries.

=== Angular

==== TL;DR:

Angular is not supported in STEMCstudio.

==== Why

Angular is a powerful and complete framework for building web applications. It has an HTML templating language, routing, components, services, dependency injection, and many other features. This is simply much more than we need in an intermediate size application. It is also not supported natively by STEMCstudio because the complexity of the packages makes it difficult to consume.

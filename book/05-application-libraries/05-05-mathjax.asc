=== Rendering Mathematics

Rendering mathematical notation in your application is currently done by using _MathJax_. The simplest way to use this library in your STEMCstudio application is to select _mathjax_ as a _Project Dependency_ in _Project Settings_.

Surround your LaTeX expression to be rendered by `$$` on either side, or `\[` and `\]`.

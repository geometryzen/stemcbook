=== Foreword

_STEMCstudio_ is a modern live coding environment that has been optimized for the development of STEM Computing educational activities. It can be used standalone, but also works seamlessly with LTI Advantage.

The _Learning Tools Interoperabilty 1.3_ (LTI Advantage) standard defines the second generation of content creation for educational platforms by allowing external tools to be embedded securely as activities in courses.

Both technologies are powerful, but can be intimidating, and you may be left wondering how to get started, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

Demystifying these technologies and getting you productive is what this book is all about. I believe that improving STEM technology for the benefit of learners everywhere is a journey and that we are on the right path. I hope you'll join me!

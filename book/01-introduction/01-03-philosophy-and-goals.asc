=== Philosophy and Goals

The following ideas have informed the development of STEMCstudio and it's ecosystem of libraries.

* Computers are about _insight_, not just numbers.
* Computers are an expander/compressor of space and time. Books, videos and other non-interactive media have revolutionized learning by making the learning process independent of the time and location of the sage. Computers allow us to experience the world at different scales of space and time and allow us to learn rapidly from our mistakes.
* _Leverage the synergies_ between computing, mathematics, and physics to make the whole student learning experience more satisfying and productive.
* Support the _modernization_ of the mathematics and science curriculum.
* Support learning _fundamentals_ and essential subject elements.
* Support _access for all_.
* Make _mathematical and physical modeling_ an _active learning_ experience.
* Support a _constructive_, _modeling_ and _inquiry-based_ pedagogy.
* Support an _integrated_ _computing_ and _STEM_ curriculum.
* _Consolidate_ the _tools_ needed for computing across all STEM disciplines, _reducing cognitive load_ for students and teachers alike.
* Support new ways of teaching _Geometry_ and _Geometric Algebra_ by using _3D Computer Graphics_.
* Introduce _modern software development best practices_ to the student.
* Standards are better than proprietary.
* Libraries are the way to manage domain complexity, not tools and languages. It is better to have fewer tools to learn. It is better to have more flexible tools and then achieve productivity and consistency through the use of libraries.
* Design the tool for the expert, make it usable for the novice.
* Libraries should be highly coherent and loosely coupled. In other words, it should be easy to use libraries together to assemble more complex solutions, and to substitute new parts to enhance existing solutions.

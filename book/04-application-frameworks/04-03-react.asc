=== React

==== TL;DR;

React is a highly recommended approach to building sophisticated learning content in STEMCstudio.

STEMCstudio natively supports _`react`_ and _`react-dom`_ as dependencies but you can also explicitly configure
the dependencies yourself. 

==== Why

React is described as a library for building user interfaces. It provides an excellent Developer Experience (DX) because of its technical underpinnings; React uses the _jsx_ standard as the file format which is an extension of JavaScript to support HTML creating through the DOM. Furthermore, this format is understood by TypeScript and extended to give a _tsx_ standard, which is _jsx__ with TypeScript type annotations. What this amounts to is that the STEMCstudio development environment is able to give you lots of help in authoring your user interface code.

==== How

React requires you to write some functions or classes that follow a pattern.

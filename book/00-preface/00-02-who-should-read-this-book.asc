=== Who Should Read This Book

==== Educational Content Authors

Modern ventures are often characterized by teams of specialists working together towards a common goal. There is every reason to believe that producing high quality educational content, just like producing a modern web site, will be enhanced by a team approach. That being said, new concepts are also pioneered by individuals who are motivated to go beyond their area of expertise in order to produce novel outcomes.

For the aforementioned reasons, this book is dually targetted at both the team producing educational content and the pioneer educator who is willing to learn the technical aspects needed to bring instruction online.

==== Computational Modeling Students

STEMCstudio was originally written with the student in mind. The goal of STEMCstudio was to enable Computational Modeling Experimentation for Students by lowering the Software Engineering bar. In other words, configuring an application, executing the application,  and deploying it should be easy and the core task should be about the scientific model, translating it into code, and not much more. But STEMCstudio does not attempt to produce a zero-code experience wich would reduce flexibility. It achieves a low-code experience by being able to use standard and custom libraries and embraces a high-quality developer programming experience that would be familiar to a modern front-end web developer. Because the programming language used by STEMCstudio is an industry standard, I have been able to avoid turning this book into a programming tutorial. This book instead focuses on those unique aspects of STEMCstudio do not have explainations elsewhere.

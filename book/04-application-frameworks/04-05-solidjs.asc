==== Introduction

SolidJS is a relative newcomer to the application framework space.

==== How it Works

SolidJS uses a paradigm known as _signals_ to propagate changes in values to become DOM updates. It also makes use of JavaScript extensions (_jsx_) for the authoring of HTML components. The approach is described by the author as _fine-grained reactivity_ with the goal of high performance.

==== Getting Started

A template exists if you are creating a new project. What follows is a description of the unique SolidJS features of that the template, or how to modify your project so that it supports SolidJS.

The package dependencies required for running SolidJS in STEMCstudio are `solid-js`, and `csstype`.

In addition to adding the dependencies to your _package.json_ file, it will be necessary to define overrides in _studio.config.json_:

Finally the `jsx` and `jsxImportSource` properties in _tsconfig.json_ should be configured to compile JavaScript extensions appropriate for SolidJS.

You are now ready to create your STEMCstudio application using the SolidJS framework.

The boilerplate code for bootstrapping your application is in the _index.tsx_ file.

The _index.html_ file contains an `HTMLDivElement`, which is the mounting point for the `App`.

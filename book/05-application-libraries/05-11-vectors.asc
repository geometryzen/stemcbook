=== Numeric Vector and Geometric Algebra

Manipulating geometric quantities such as scalars and vectors in a coordinate-free manner is a rite of passage for a student and an extremely useful technique, especially in the age of computers where such computations can be performed at speed, flawlessly, and with economical expression in code.

This example uses the '@geometryzen/multivectors' package to provide the computations:

[source,ts,linenos]

----

The '@geometryzen/multivectors' package provides ideal resources for STEMCstudio and so no overrides are required.

The 'index.html' file defines a 'pre' (preserve) element in which to place the result.

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_

----

The 'index.ts' makes various calulations and prints the results. Note the (optional) use of operator overloading.

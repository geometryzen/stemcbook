=== Charting with Chart.js

==== Chart.js

Chart.js is described as

Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for the modern web

The official web page is

You can view a STEMCstudio sample application at the following URL:

The code for this example can be found at the following URL:

The web page contains extensive examples.  Here I will only describe the setup required to allow Chart.js to run in STEMCstudio.

Your project will contain the obligatory _index.html_ file.

NOTE: Because Chart.js uses the HTMLCanvasElement, your HTML document must contain a canvas element.

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_

include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/bf1b63181f7192f104fd883af1219afb/raw/index.html?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The _index.ts_ file does the work of configuring the chart and loading the data. 

[source,ts,linenos]
._index.ts_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/bf1b63181f7192f104fd883af1219afb/raw/index.ts?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

When you add a dependency for Chart.js, you will search for _chart.js_. One the dependency has been added, it will be stored in the _package.json_ file under the _dependencies_ property.

[source,json,linenos]
._package.json_

----

STEMCstudio has an override for _chart.js_ because the package cannot be consumed directly by only looking at the _package.json_ file for _chart.js_. The override gets stored in the _studio.config.json_ file. You may modify this file if you know what you are doing.

[source,json,linenos]
._studio.config.json_

include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/bf1b63181f7192f104fd883af1219afb/raw/studio.config.json?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

From the _studio.config.json_ file, STEMCstudio generates the files used for design-time and run-time.

_types.config.json_ is used at design-time and provides the location of the TypeScript type definitions.

In the case of _chart.js_, we only need to know the location of its _package.json_ file to find the type definitions.

[source,json,linenos]
._types.config.json_

----

_system.config.json_ is used at run-time and provides the location of the executable JavaScript code.

In the case of _chart.js_, we ignore the _package.json_ file and elect to use the UMD module format code.

[source,json,linenos]
._system.config.json_

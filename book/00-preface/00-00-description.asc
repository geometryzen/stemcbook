=== Foreword

_STEMCstudio_ is a modern live coding environment that has been optimized for the development of STEM Computing educational activities. It can be used standalone, but also works seamlessly with LTI Advantage.

The _Learning Tools Interoperabilty 1.3_ (LTI Advantage) standard defines the second generation of content creation for educational platforms by allowing external tools to be embedded securely as activities in courses.

Both technologies are powerful, but can be intimidating, and you may be left wondering how to get started, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

Fortunately, you have a resource, written by the creator of STEMCstudio, at your disposal in _STEMCbook: How to create Interactive Learning Activities using STEMCstudio and LTI_ that will demystify the technologies and make you productive right away. David Holmes has taken the knowledge he has gained in building dynamic applications and laid it out in a way that is easy to follow and understand. The book is packed with working examples that will help you get up to speed quickly.

=== Rendering Mathematics in STEMCstudio

The underlying Web technology that allows STEMCstudio to support the rendering of mathematics is called MathML.
This technology is supported by most modern web browsers.

So the most direct way of rendering mathematics is simply to write MathML in your `index.html` file:

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/b95e9e31c795ac7137a136b49838a5e6/raw/index.html?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The approach above requires no special support from STEMCstudio and no additional libraries because it is built in to all browsers. However, this approach can be tedious and so it is common for authors to express their mathematics to be rendered in a language called `TeX` and have some library convert the `TeX` to HTML. In this book we will look at two popular libraries for converting `TeX`to HTML; MathJax and KaTeX.

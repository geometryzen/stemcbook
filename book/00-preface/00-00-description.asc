=== Foreword

_STEMCstudio_ is a web-based educational tool for authoring STEM learning activities, such as demonstrations and assignments, and for student project-based learning of science and math through computational modeling. A STEM educational resource created using STEMCstudio may be run either standalone, embedded in another web site as an IFrame, or embedded in a Learning Management System using the LTI 1.3 protocol. Projects created with STEMCstudio are themselves web applications using modern standards-based web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Using STEMCstudio, the complex software engineering tasks of building and deployment are avoided, allowing the educator and student to focus on the educational problem domain.

The _Learning Tools Interoperabilty_ (LTI) version 1.3 standard defines the next generation of content creation for educational platforms by allowing external tools to be embedded securely as activities in courses. Using this technology allows applications called _tools_ to be plugged into the LMS _platform_ and safely interact with the LMS gradebook. STEMCstudio is one such _tool_ and therefore facilitates the creation of educational resources for deployment in an LMS.

Both STEMCstudio and LTI 1.3 technologies are powerful, especially when used together, but they can be intimidating, and you may be left wondering how to get started, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

Demystifying these technologies and getting you productive is what this book is all about.

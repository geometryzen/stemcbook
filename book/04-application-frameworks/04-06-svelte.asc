=== Svelte

==== Introduction

Svelte is relative newcomer to the web application framework space.

WARNING: The Svelte implementation in STEMCstudio is experimental. Issues can happen if the version of Svelte used to compile your `*.svelte` files does not match the version of the Svelte dependency in your project. This should not affect any projects that have been compiled and deployed. For now, only the `3.59.1` version of Svelte is supported.

==== How it Works

Svelte uses its own proprietary __svelte__ format to define the user interface. Svelte employs a compiler to convert the propietary format into executable JavaScript. The proprietary __svelte__ format looks like HTML with embedded JavaScript in `script` tags and is designed to reduce the amount of code needed to create fragments of HTML, but it is at the expense of less powerful tooling. To date, there is no first-class parser and analyzer for __svelte__ files.

==== Getting Started

A template exists if you are creating a new project. What follows is a description of the unique Svelte features of that the template, or how to modify your project so that it supports Svelte.

The package dependencies required for running Svelte in STEMCstudio are `svelte`.

In addition to adding the dependencies to your _package.json_ file, it will be necessary to define overrides in _studio.config.json_:

You are now ready to create your STEMCstudio application using the SolidJS framework.

The boilerplate code for bootstrapping your application is in the _index.ts_ file.

The _index.html_ file contains an `HTMLDivElement`, which is the mounting point for the `App`.

Components are created their own files and must have the extension `.svelte`

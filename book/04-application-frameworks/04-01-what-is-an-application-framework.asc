=== What is a Web Application Framework?

A Web Application Framework provides an alternative way to interact and update the DOM that may streamline the developer experience of DOM updating and may also encourage a more modular approach to assembling a web application. Increasingly, modern frameworks will use an alternate representation for the DOM from pure HTML and will require a compiler to convert the developer source code into JavaScript for execution.

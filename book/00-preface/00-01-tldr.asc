=== STEMCstudio in a Nutshell

Things you SHOULD know about STEMCstudio, even if you are in a hurry. Read this section if you want to know if STEMCstudio will be useful to you. 

==== It is a Live Coding Environment, in the Web Browser.

You write code, it shows you the results immediately. Nothing to install.

==== Optimized for, and enables, Educational Activity Authoring.

To back up this claim, here's a list of features that you are unlikely to see together elsewhere.

* _Learning Tools Interoperability 1.3_. It can be launched by an LMS and interacts with the Gradebook. 
* _Applications Open for Extension_. Invoke any external JavaScript library to achieve low code and productivity.
* _Smart IDE_. Semantic analysis features so that you can retain control of your source code and scale to non-trivial applications.
* _Goldilocks Software Engineering_. Just the features you need to feel like a Pro without needing a Comp Sci degree.
* _Operator Overloading (optional)_. Allows computation to look like authentic mathematical numbers.

==== Runs in 4 Modes

* _Standalone_. Enter the _stemcstudio.com_ URL in your web browser and start creating.
* _LTI tool activity in your LMS_. Launched when the student clicks on a task.
* _Embedded in your web site as an IFrame_. We even have a feature to help you build the embeddable string.
* _Embedded as an execute-only application in your web site_. Use the _stemcviewer.com_ companion application. Super fast. Great for demonstrations.

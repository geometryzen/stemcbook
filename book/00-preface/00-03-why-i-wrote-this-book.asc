=== Why I Wrote This Book

An educator friend once told me that STEMCstudio seems complex, but it isn't. At the time I was taking him on a personal tour through STEMCstudio. Of course, I can't do that with every potential STEMCstudio user. 

I was originally motivated to write STEMCstudio as a means to explore Physics and Mathematics concepts through Computational Modeling. Bringing the value of experiencing what are normally abstract concepts to students was sufficient motivation for me to scratch together a Wiki describing STEMCstudio. But that Wiki got out of date and it couldn't stay synchronized with code examples. I have produced a number of YouTube videos about STEMCstudio and Geometric Algebra but these are sequential access and don't capture recent developments. 

When educators got interested in STEMCstudio for dynamic content authoring, and when I saw the transformational potential of Learning Tools Interoperability, I felt it was time to produce a book about how STEMCstudio and LTI could work together. Publishing technology has advanced considerably since the days when I started STEMCstudio. Now there was no excuse!

It is permissible in mostmodern languages to use Unicode characters in symbol names. JavaScript and TypeScript allow Unicode characters. In mathematical and science contexts this can be improve the readability of your code.

[TIP]
====
In business Information Technology (IT) environments it is considered best practice to use long and complete descriptive names to convey the correspondence between a software variable and some entity in the world that is being modeled.

However, in scientific applications, I have found that it pays to be more nuanced about symbol names. In an appropriate context, such as a formula, with well known input varaiables, the code may be more readable if it uses very short or even single character variable names.

Select the symbol you would like to use with your mouse. This will copy the symbol to the clipboard. Now place the caret in your editor at the place where you would like to use the symbol and press _Ctrl-V_ to paste it. The Greek Symbols popup window will automatically close when focus moves back to the editor.

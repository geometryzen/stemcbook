=== Deep Linking

Deep Linking allows Activities and Resources defined in the tool to be linked to the LMS with minimal manual configuration. The user interface of the tool itself is used to configure the link. In the case of STEMCstudio, this means selecting the project (Gist) and setting the parameters that determine how the workspace appears.

Creating a new Activity in Moodle requires the following steps:

1. Select a Course.
2. Add an activity or resource.
3. Select _External Tool_ as the activity type.
4. Choose _STEMCstudio_ from the list of preconfigured tools (STEMCviewer can also be chosen and is a simpler process)
5. Press the _Select content_ button.

This will navigate you to the STEMCstudio Home Page. From here you can select your STEMCstudio project in two ways.

1. Log in to GitHub in STEMCstudio and _download_ your project. 
2. Find the project in the _STEMCarXiv_ (assuming you have published it).

If the workspace opens with your project, you will need to navigate back to the STEMCstudio Home Page in order to see your project with a _Link_ button.

Press the _Link_ button to begin the _Deep Linking_ process.

STEMCstudio will now present you with a dialog that will enable you to configure your resource.

The top part of the dialog offers configuration parameters.

The bottom part of the dialog shows you what will be displayed.

Use the _Graded_ and _Coding_ checkboxes to define the coarse behavior. Use the remaining options to fine tune the activity. You can think of the _Graded_ and _Coding_ options as dividing the space of activity into four kinds:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Graded | Coding | Kind of Activity

| No    | No     | Demonstration
| No    | Yes    | Student Coding Exploration
| Yes   | No     | Quiz or Question  
| Yes   | Yes    | Graded Coding Exercise
|===

NOTE: There is no intrinsic meaning to the _Graded_ and _Coding_ options; they merely cause sensible choices to be made for the options below them.

Once you are satisfied with your choice of options, press the _OK_ button.

This will return you to the LMS where you can Save the activity.

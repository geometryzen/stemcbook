=== Programming API

STEMCstudio provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows you to access the following LTI services:

Assignments and Grades Service, and
Names and Roles Service.
Interaction with these services from your STEMCstudio application happens through the 'stemcstudio-tunnel' package. This package provides abstractions that represent the Gradebook, the User, and the Cohort defined by the users' registration in a course. For example, following the selection of `stemcstudio-tunnel` as a dependency, the following import makes these services available as objects:

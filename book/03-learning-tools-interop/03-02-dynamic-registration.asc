=== Dynamic Registration

Dynamic Registration is an automated process for establishing secure communication parameters for the tool (STEMCstudio in this case) and the platform (e.g. Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, Sakai). Once registration is complete, the tool can be launched securely using the identity of the user logged into the LMS.

The URL to use for dynamically registering STEMCstudio is `https://stemcstudio.com/tool`.

NOTE: You will use STEMCstudio for the creation of learning resources. STEMCstudio provides both the design-time environment for resource creation as well as the run-time environment for executing and previewing your creations. However, if all you want to do is to execute your creations either standalone or in a Learning Management System then it is more efficient to execute them using STEMCviewer. Not only will STEMCview load faster, but it will also prevent access to the source code for your project. 

The URL to use for dynamically registering STEMCviewer is `https://stemcviewer.com/tool`.

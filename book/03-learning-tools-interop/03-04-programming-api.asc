=== Programming API

STEMCstudio provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows you to access the following LTI services:

Assignments and Grades Service, and Names and Roles Service.

Interaction with these services from your STEMCstudio application happens through the 'stemcstudio-tunnel' package. This package provides abstractions that represent the Gradebook, the User, and the Cohort defined by the users' registration in a course.

This diagram illustrates the intermediaries involved in accessing the _Gradebook_ from _Your Code_:

NOTE: The communication between _Your Code_ and the _STEMCstudio App_ is performed - behind the scenes - as message passing because your application is running in an _HTMLIFrameElement_. Additionally, the communication between the _STEMCstudio App_ and both servers happens using _HTTPS_ web service calls. For both these reasons, the communication between _Your Code_ and the _gradebook_ must be asynchronous. This will require some familiarity with either the JavaScript _Promise_ API or the _async_/_await_ syntax. 


To get started we must make `stemcstudio-tunnel` available as a dependency. Having done that, the following import makes the LTI services available as JavaScript objects:

NOTE: The following code examples are taken from the STEMCstudio project https://www.stemcstudio.com/gists/96ea9435cb61fa7ba342bb226fb99623. When you run this project in STEMCstudio outside of the LMS, STEMCstudio will simulate some responses to aid in application development. When you deploy your application to your LMS it will use the real LTI services.

WARNING: Be sure to be signed on with the correct roles when testing your LTI activity. If your _admin_ or _instructor_ is not enrolled in the course you are developing then requests such as submitting scores will fail.

==== Get the Gradebook Items (Columns) for the current Activity.

You'll need to do this if you want to submit scores to the gradebook. The zeroth element of the `Item[]` array returned by `gradebook.getItems()` contains the gradebook column for the current activity and has an identifier property called `id`.

NOTE: The zeroth element of the `Item[]` array is the default gradebook column. We will see later that it is possible to add additional gradebook columns for the current activity.

==== Submit Score for the current Activity.

Submitting a score for the current activity requires that you provide the identifier of the gradebook column.

==== Get Results for the current Activity

Getting the results for the current activity and student is

==== Creating a new Gradebook Item (Column) for the current Activity.

Every activity has, by default, exactly one gradebook item when it is created. However, the LTI Advantage API allows you to create new columns on-the-fly for the current activity. This is how it is done:

==== Get Membership for the current Activity Context.

You probably won't need to do this. The Names and Roles Service allows tools to synchronize with the course membership in the LMS.

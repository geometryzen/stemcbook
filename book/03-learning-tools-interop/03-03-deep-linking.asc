=== Deep Linking

Deep Linking allows Activities and Resources defined in the tool to be linked to the LMS with minimal manual configuration. The user interface of the tool itself is used to configure the link. In the case of STEMCstudio, this means selecting the project (Gist) and setting the parameters that determine how the workspace appears.

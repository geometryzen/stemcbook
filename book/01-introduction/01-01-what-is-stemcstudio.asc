=== What is STEMCstudio?

STEMCstudio is a revolutionary web-based live-programming environment that has been optimized for scientific and educational computing to enhance mathematical, physical, and computational learning.
STEMCstudio goes beyond introductory programming environments by providing a sophisticated and scalable - yet easy to use - development experience that allows larger, more complex, computational projects to be tackled without the software engineering hassles of building and deployment.
The remarkable and distinguishing features that make this possible are IntelliSense, modular programming, and seamless 3rd party library integration.
STEMCstudio is ideal for advanced high-school students, undergraduate students, educators and researchers.

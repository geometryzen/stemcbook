=== Data Visualization with Plotly

==== Plotly

Plotly is a JavaScript Open Source Graphing Library.

JavaScript examples for various chart types are documented by the _plotly_ maintainers at https://plotly.com/javascript/. It is usually fairly straightforward to adapt these to TypeScript and use them in STEMCstudio.

You can try the application at the following URL:

The code for this example can be found at the following URL:

The official _npm_ page is https://www.npmjs.com/package/plotly.js. This page informs you of the runtime versions and locations on the CDN. Unfortunately, the developers behind _plotly_ don't provide the TypeScript type definitions. However, a number of versions are hosted on the STEMCstudio server.

Configuring STEMCstudio to use plotly involves creating a dependency in `package.json` and having an override in `studio.config.json`.

NOTE: The runtime implementation for plotly is provided by a UMD module.

As a result of this configuration, the generated _system.config.json_ and _types.config.json_ files will look like:

._system.config.json_

The _index.html_ file provides a placeholder for the chart by using a `div` element:

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_

include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/8191c1070bc5d68cd223a33f01ce4d53/raw/index.html?cache_bust='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The _index.ts_ file configures and constructs the chart. The code differs from the official JavaScript documentation by having a ES Module import for the package `plotly.js`, `const` variables, and the creation of the plot using the exported `newPlot` function rather than the global `Plotly` variable:

=== Simulations and the Physics Engine

This example provides an accurate simulation of elastic collisions. It uses a physics engine to compute the motion of colliding blocks. The custom collision handling code detects when a collision occurs and backtracks the physics engine to the collision point, applies the momenta exchanges, and then advances the simulation. The JsxGraph package is used to render the simulation, and JsxGraph is wrapped by another external package as blocks with a visual representation and a model that comes from the physics engine.

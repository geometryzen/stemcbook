=== Code Editing using monaco-editor

_monaco-editor_ is a browser based code editor.

You can try the application at the following URL:

The code for this example can be found at the following URL:

The first step is to add _monaco-editor_ as a dependency to your project. This can either be done by using the _Add Dependency_ button in the _Explorer_ toolbar, or by editing the _package.json_ file directly. The end result should be the same and the _package.json_ file will be as follows: 

[source,json,linenos]
._package.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/1b9ac72f9381d7ccf68add45f147aa58/raw/package.json?index.ts='{revdatetime}'[]
----

The purpose of adding the dependency is to get access to the _monaco.d.ts_ type definitions. We'll need an override in _studio.config.json_ to tell STEMCstudio where to find the _monaco.d.ts_ file.

[source,json,linenos]
._studio.config.json_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/1b9ac72f9381d7ccf68add45f147aa58/raw/studio.config.json?index.ts='{revdatetime}'[]
----

We now have to load the runtime for the _monaco-editor_. This is done in our _index.html_ file.

[source,html,linenos]
._index.html_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/1b9ac72f9381d7ccf68add45f147aa58/raw/index.html?index.ts='{revdatetime}'[]
----

An important detail in the _index.html_ file is that we have taken control of the loading of our _index.js_ file using _System.import_. This ensures that the _index.js_ file loads only after the _monaco-editor_ global variable 'monaco' has been set.

Finally, we are ready in _index.ts_ to create the editor...

[source,ts,linenos]
._index.ts_
----
include::https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stemcstudio/1b9ac72f9381d7ccf68add45f147aa58/raw/index.ts?index.ts='{revdatetime}'[]
----

An important detail in this file is the _export_ at the bottom that ensures that the _index.ts_ file is loaded as an EcmaScript module.

You should find that _IntelliSense_ is working and that the 'monaco' global variable is recognized as a _namespace_.

Congratulations! You now have _monaco-editor_ working in your STEMCstudio application.

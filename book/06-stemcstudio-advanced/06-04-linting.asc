=== Linting

(((Linting)))
Linting is the process in which your code is checked for the presence of certain patterns. The goal is to provide hints to improve the quality of your code. In STEMCstudio, the output from the Linter is reported as warning in your editor. The Linter only runs when your project is free from syntax and semantic errors.

The settings for the Linter are defined in the configuration file _tslint.json_. The default values have been carefully chosen to provide useful assistance without being overly burdensome.

Linting may be turned on or off using the _Linting_ check box in Project Settings.

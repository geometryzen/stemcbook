JsxGraph is desribed as a JavaScript library for interactive geometry. It is known especially for 2D rendering but can also render in 3D. The underlying rendering technology is pluggable but the most common technology used is Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The programming API consists of defining geometric elements, usually starting with points, and connecting them together to create geometric constructions. JsxGraph is able to render diagrams as well as text. JsxGraph is also an excellent utility for constructing specialized diagrams e.g. mechanics, electronics, and electrodynamics.

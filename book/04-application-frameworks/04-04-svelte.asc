=== Svelte

==== TL;DR;

Svelte is a moderately recommended approach to building sophisticated learning content in STEMCstudio.

STEMCstudio natively supports the _`svelte`_ dependency but you can also explicitly configure
the dependencies yourself.

STEMCstudio supports Svelte as a kind of experiment and to give the library the benefit of the doubt.

==== Why

Svelte uses its own proprietary __svelte__ format to define the user interface. This enables it to reduce the amout of code written, but it is at the expense of less powerful tooling. To date, there is no first-class parser and analyzer for __svelte__ files. If you wish to combine Svelte with TypeScript then the future is bleak for first-class tooling given the evolving nature os TypeScript.
